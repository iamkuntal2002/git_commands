SELECT

(we can use SELECT keyword without FROM clause like
SELECT 12+23;
SELECT now();	//gives the current time
SELECT ucase("kuntal");		//change to uppercase
SELECT lcase("KUTAL");		//change to lowercase
)

WHERE		//reduce rows based on given conditions

SELECT * FROM table_name 
WHERE id>10;

BETWEEN 		//

SELECT * FROM table_name 
WHERE id BETWEEN 10 AND 20;		//10 and 20 are inclusive

IN		//to reduce or commands

(select * from table where roll is 12 or 32 or 34;	//have to write too much code, instead use
select * from table where roll in (12,32,34);
)

AND : WHERE cond1 AND cond2
OR : WHERE cond1 or cond2
NOT : WHERE col_name NOT IN (1,3,4,5)

IS NULL : SELECT * FROM table WHERE EMAIL IS NULL;

LIKE : it used for pattern searching using %
	SELECT * FROM table WHERE name LIKE '%un%';	//any number of character can be present before or after "un"
	SELECT * FROM table WHERE name LIKE '_un%';	//only one character can be present before "un" and any number of characters can be present after 'un'

ORDER BY : sort the data
		SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY roll;	//default ascending
		SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY roll DESC;		//sort in descending order

DISTINCT : 	//to see the distinct values from any column
		SELECT DISTINCT name FROM school;	//gives all the names where no duplicate name is present

GROUP BY : 	//it generally used with some aggregation functions
		like COUNT,SUM,AVG,MIN,MAX
		SELECT department, COUNT(department) FROM student GROUP BY department;		//gives the count of students from each department
		SELECT department, SUM(roll) FROM student GROUP BY department;			//gives the total sum of rolls from each department
		SELECT department, MIN(marks) FROM student GROUP BY departments;		//gives the min marks from each department
		
GROUP BY HAVING : 	//similar to where clause
		SELECT department, COUNT(names) FROM student GROUP BY departments HAVING SUM(salary) > 100000;
